A very basic minecraft chat uwuifier

Use /uwuconfig to control it. You can toggle between whitelist and blacklist modes, and add or remove people from both. Running uwuconfig without giving a value to set something to will show what that value currently is. Running just uwuconfig will show all available info

In whitelist mode, only players in the whitelist will have their messages uwuified

In blacklist mode, everyone except players in the blacklist will have their messages uwuified

The errors if the server console or rcon says something are a known issue
